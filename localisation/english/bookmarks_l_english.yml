GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Rising Zaatensions"
GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The establishment of Zaatcord, or My Awesome Empire, or whatever other names people call it have revolutionized the organized Anti-Canksitan resistance. Headed by none other than Wooferdooper, a stubborn and restless individual, through opportunism after the slow collapse of the decadent Awesome States of Spide, finds themselves in a position of uncertainity. The forces that united Zaatcordians together is dwindling, and plots against Wooferdooper form and expand upon by the day. Only through action of either Wooferdooper, or a Fifth Column, will put an end to Zaatensions, for better or worse."

the .mod file "ZAAT" is here just in case i update it to add any "replace=" blocks.

make sure to replace the old .zaat file whenever it does update,

ALSO MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE PATH FILE LOCATION!!!!

path="C:/Users/penis man/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/project-zaat"

^ is MY path, change it to YOUR path to the DOCUMENTS paradox folder, NOT your steam!!!

easy way to do this:

File Explorer > look at the top where the file paths are, right click project-zaat

"Copy Address as text"

Ex: C:\Users\penis man\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\project-zaat

change BACKSLASHES (\) TO FORWARD SLASHES (/)

paste in path=" "!

congrats it should work now
